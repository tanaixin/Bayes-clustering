# Bayes-clustering
Simulation setup 
1. K=2 components for the intercept
2. K>=2 components for the intercept
3. K=2 components for the (intercept, slope)
3. K=2 components for the (intercept, slope, variance)

Issues: 
1. MFM vs DPM
2. effective MCMC (from Neal's algorithm 8 to split-merge) 
3. Choice of hyperparameters using EB or ?, especially for gamma in MFM and alpha in DPM.
